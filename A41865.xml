            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>Licenſed <hi>J. Fraſer,</hi> and Entred according to Odrer. 1690.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>WE are juſt now come to <hi>Highlake,</hi> having been for ſome time Cruſing before <hi>Dublin,</hi> whither our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, Captain <hi>John Inwings,</hi> was ordered out-laſt Week, taking their Majeſties Ship the <hi>Dover,</hi> Captain <hi>Whitaker</hi> Commander, along for our Aſſiſtance; we Arrived at <hi>Dublin</hi> on <hi>Friday</hi> laſt, about Eleven at Night, where we came to an Anchor, and ſent our Boats to and again over the <hi>Bay</hi> all that Night, and the next Day, who had the ſucceſs to take ſeveral ſmall Veſſels, with a conſiderable number of Priſoners and <hi>Proteſtants.</hi> Our taking of ſo many Barks and other Veſſels did ſo inrage the <hi>Iriſh</hi> that they planted a ſtrong Battery of Cannon upon one ſide of the <hi>Bay,</hi> and play'd very ſmartly upon us all <hi>Saturday</hi> Morning, with no effect.
<pb facs="tcp:104530:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>Our Commander then ordered to weigh Anchor, and coming nearer to them, returned upon them ſo hot Broad-ſides, notwithſtanding all the place was full of Men, and tho' they had a Breaſt-Work thrown up, which was in a great meaſure a ſecurity from our Shot; yet it was very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant to ſee with what pannick Fear and Confuſion they run, every one a different way, in the greateſt Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion imaginable, making tryal of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry appearance of a hiding place. The Horſes run as confuſedly and diſorderly as the Men, and being madded with noiſe and diſorder trod doown many of their Valiant Riders; for, though there were a great number of Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men (for they feared our coming a ſhore) yet, in a little time not a Man was to be ſeen on Horſeback, ſave the late King <hi>James,</hi> endeavouring to put Courage into that ſpiritleſs Crew; but all He could do was, with great difficulty, to get their Guns carried off, and was forced to quit his Horſe; upon which our Commander imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ordered the Boats on Shore, and heading them in Perſen, took a ſmall Veſſel in ſight of ſeveral Troops of <hi>Dragoons,</hi> that had came freſh from <hi>Dublin;</hi> But ſo ſoon as our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander ordered the two Boats Crew a Shore, it was pleaſant to ſhew how ſuch as were ou Horſeback did Scam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and ſuch as were on Foot did climb upon the Rocks like ſo many Goats.</p>
            <p>In fine, It not being ſafe for ſo ſmall a Number of our Boats Crew to advance far, our Commander was contented to bring ſome of their Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes on Board our Ship, by the little Veſſel he had taken in their Eye, for a token of their Cowardice, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Courage, among which was the late King <hi>James</hi>'s Horſe, which he had quitted) to <hi>Highlake,</hi> and ſet them on Shore. In all the Action (though they loſt conſiderable as we could viſibly ſee, and Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners after taken confirmed) we loſt not one Man. The <hi>Proteſtants</hi> and Priſoners tell us, That juſt before this Action fell out, advice came to King <hi>James</hi> at <hi>Dublin,</hi> That the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Town of <hi>Droghedagh</hi> was loſt; Duke <hi>Schomberg</hi> having Detached a ſtrong Party of Horſe, Foot, and Dragoons, conſiſting of 5000 Men, under the Command of Lieutenant General <hi>Douglas,</hi> who inveſting the Place, immediately ordered their Miners, and raiſed a ſtrong Battery of whole and Demy Cannon, which, in a little time, made ſo great a breach in the Old Wall, that our Men, after having filled up the Ditch, entred the Town Pell-mell, and put all that did not immediately lay down their Arms to the Sword.</p>
            <p>All the Priſoners profeſs themſelves willing and glad to be taken from the Miſery, they feared would come upon them. By which you may judge what may be expected if our King were once over.</p>
